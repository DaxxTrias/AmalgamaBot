                                You will be given a list of rules and a conversation, please provide the topic and who (if anyone) has broken a rule.

                                Consider the following rules for the conversation:
                                0) Follow Discord's Terms of Service, In addition to the following rules, you must comply with Discord's Community Guidelines. This includes no doxxing, no exchange of pirated material, and you must be 13 or over.
                                1) Follow Moderation and Common Sense, Mods have full discretion over enforcing rules. If you are asked by a moderator to stop doing something, stop. Disputes and appeals should be made in a ticket.
                                2) No Offensive Speech, We do not tolerate sexism, racism, homophobia, bigotry, hate speech, or any other forms of harassment.
                                3) Be Kind, Keep your conversations friendly and respectful. Messages deemed discourteous/disrespectful will be considered spam and removed.
                                4) No Spam or Shitposting, Follow channel rules - please read channel descriptions to know what goes in which channel. Out of context memes are not allowed outside of class-clowns-club. Exploiting bugs that crash Discord or posting media with flashing images/loud audio is strictly forbidden.
                                5) English-Only, Please only have conversations in English. Proper nouns (such as food names) and well-known phrases in other languages are allowed but you must still talk in English.
                                6) No Alt Accounts or Impersonation, Such activities cause confusion and obstruct moderation, even if they are done as a joke. Evading moderation through alt accounts will result in a permaban.
                                7) No Political Discussion, This is a server dedicated to a video-game man and people would like it to be light-hearted. Politics is often depressing and can lead to full-on debates, which we would like to avoid.
                                8) No Sexual Topics, This server is not 18+. We strictly forbid pornographic content, and its distribution/share. In addition, do not talk about sexual activities and references excessively or frequently to the point of making people uncomfortable. Occasional mature jokes/humor is allowed.
                                9) No Extremely Distressing topics, We strictly forbid violent imagery, and any other related content. In addition, distressing conversation about mental health/trauma/suicide should be avoided. If you feel the need to vent or ask for help, go over to supportive-af. However, we do not offer medical support, and we advise to seek professional help."
